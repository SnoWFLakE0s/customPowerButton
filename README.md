# customPowerButton
Documentation and reference materials repository for custom PC power buttons.
A selection of CAD files will be included in this repository for reference by anyone needing them. 

## Preface
A commonly used option for power switches on custom PC cases is the "standard" panel mount momentary switch. These come in a variety of sizes and configurations and can be pretty easily sourced from Aliexpress or other digital part suppliers at around $2~3 per item. See below for an example on a case like the Densium 4+ v2.

These come in a variety of configurations, typically coming in 12mm/16mm/19mm/22mm through-hole sizes (actual diameter of the button shroud itself is larger), with multiple options for voltage ratings (3~6V, 12~24V, 220V configs) and the option to use LEDs either as a ring around the button or as an imprinted illuminated icon on the button.

If you would like to use this for a PC power switch, most motherboard power switch LED headers (typically labeled PLED (+)/(-)) will run 5V, and you should select a power switch configured for that voltage. As far as the actual power swtich function is concerned, these voltage ratings do not matter as much should you choose not to have a LED as all it does it provide continuity.

Here is my example of a custom power switch job.

You can get pretty premium results provided you take care to get good finishes on sleeving and soldering. The BOM for my power switch is as follows:
1. 22mm White LED (3-6V) Momentary Switch
2. 4 x 30 cm looms of 24 AWG wires, ideally sets of Red/Black
3. 4 x 2.54mm Dupont Female Crimp Terminals
4. 2 x (2-by-1) 2.54mm Dupont Female Terminal Housings
5. Heatshrink (best if for 20~24 AWG)
6. 1~1.5mm PET braiding sleeves or paracord
